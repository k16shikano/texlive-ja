Sec. 1.3 (p.3)
It still describes `-gui=text` but maybe `-no-gui` is newer?

Sec. 2.2 (p.5)
> In addition to the directories above, the installation scripts and README
> files (in various languages) are at the top level of the distribution.
Really? Maybe these have been moved to readme-* dirs?

Sec. 2.4 (p.6)
texmf-dist/doc/pdftex/manual/samplepdf/samplepdf.tex
-> texmf-dist/doc/pdftex/samplepdftex/samplepdf.tex

Sec. 3.2.4 (p.12)
The third item of the detailed option list:
"create format files" -> "create all format files"

The sixth item of the list:
"after installation ... CTAN"
It seems the option name has been changed (between 2018 and 2019) from "after
installation, get package updates from CTAN" to "after install, set CTAN as
source for package updates". Thus, the shorthand "after installation ... CTAN"
is no longer correct. I think it is better to write full text (not a shorthand)
at the first place.

Sec. 3.4.1 (p.14)
"(or another file sourced by .profile"
An unclosed parenthesis.
